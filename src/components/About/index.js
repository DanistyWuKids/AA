          <Typography className="bodyText" variant="body2">
            In the late 90s, Prof. Harald Sondergaard and Dr. Linda Stern built Algorithm in Action,
            designed for students to visualise algorithms. However, that was almost 20 years ago and the
            app fell out of use.
          </Typography>
          <Typography className="bodyText" variant="body2">
            This project aims to redevelop and redesign the application with its pioneering pedagogy
            (stepwise refinement) for the modern century.

          <Typography className="bodyText" variant="body2">
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
            the industry&apos;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
            of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
            in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
            with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
